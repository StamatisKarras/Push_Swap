Use radix sort and push the numbers back and forth in the stacks
Stack b wiill be and array of pointers that point to int arrays(That is so that I can story multiple numbers in each "cell")
Send the numbers on their corresponding cell in b and when done send them back to A.
I can dynamicly allocate space for when i wnt to add a  digit in one of the cells by  creating a new array and copying everything from the old array to the new one and the nassign the new array to the original.
